# Question

What are environment variables? How do you access them in Node?

# Answer
Environment Variables are hidden variable stored in a .env file that lives on the host (your laptop or a deployment host like Render). It basically a place that has configuration values stored outside the codebase for security and flexibility. For example we store `API_KEY="abc123"` in .env. To acess it, we need to import the environment variables from .env using the dotenv module from npm using `npm i dotenv`. Using process.env: Node.js provides the process.env object to access environment variables. For example: `process.env.API_KEY` Then, require and configure it at the beginning of your application: 
```js
require('dotenv').config();

const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
console.log(apiKey); // Output: your_api_key_here
//config
require('dotenv').config();
// or just 
const dotenv = require('dotenv');
dotenv.config();
```
