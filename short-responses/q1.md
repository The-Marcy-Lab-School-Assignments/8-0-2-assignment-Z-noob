# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer
API keys verify your identity as a developer but can be stolen by malicious users, leading to unauthorized requests, data breaches, quota abuse, service interruptions, and unexpected charges. Server-side requests prevent key exposure, reducing unauthorized use and enabling effective monitoring, management, and rapid response to security issues.
